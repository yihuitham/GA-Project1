## Little Vineyard

### Game Description

Little Vineyard is a farming simulation game inspired by Eric Barone who created Stardew Valley. He initially developed the game only to practice his programming skills. In a turn of events, the game went on to make commercial success.

In Little Vineyard, player can buy grape seeds to grow grapes. The grapes can be turned into wine by putting them in the oak. Next, the wine can be bottled and aged before selling them at the shop.

With only $3 to start with, player is to strategise how to make as much money as possible within a limited timeframe of 5 mins.

### Technologies

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Javascript**
- **Jquery**
- **Canvas** is used to allow the character to move according to player's keypress

### Approaches Taken

- Sprite sheet is used to give the illusion of the character moving.
- Each feature (e.g. crops, oak, wine bottle and shops) has an area and location in the html. This is so that upon spacebar keypress, javascript can execute the functions unique to each feature based on where the character is.
- 5 different images for the wine bottle crate were created to give player visuals of the number of bottles filled with wine.
- Another 5 different images were also used to give a visual indication of how filled the oak is.
- Objects are used to allow each crop to grow independently.
- CSS inputs are used to get user's inputs for buying and selling.

### Accomplishments

- Getting the grapes to grow one by one, and then later getting each crop to grow independent of each other
- Getting everything to work together

### Difficulties Faced

- There were glitches when it comes to buying and selling, the modals disappears as soon as it appears.
- The buying and selling of items mulitiplied on its own

### Game Instructions

Challenge yourself to make as much money as possible!
Buy some grape seeds, sow them, harvest the grapes, and then either sell the grapes or use them to make wine to earn some money.

Hint: Storing the bottles for as long as possible before selling them will earn you more money.
